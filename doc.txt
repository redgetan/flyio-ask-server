Create a backup using a collection
To create a backup of your index, use the create_collection operation. A collection is a static copy of your index that only consumes storage.

Example

The following example creates a collection named example-collection from an index named example-index.

Python
JavaScript
curl

pinecone.create_collection("example-collection", "example-index")
Check the status of a collection
To retrieve the status of the process creating a collection and the size of the collection, use the describe_collection operation. Specify the name of the collection to check. You can only call describe_collection on a collection in the current project.

The describe_collection operation returns an object containing key-value pairs representing the name of the collection, the size in bytes, and the creation status of the collection.

Example

The following example gets the creation status and size of a collection named example-collection.

Python
JavaScript
curl

pinecone.describe_collection("example-collection")
Results:

Shell

CollectionDescription(name='test-collection', size=3818809, status='Ready')
List your collections
To get a list of the collections in the current project, use the list_collections operation.

Example

The following example gets a list of all collections in the current project.

Python
JavaScript
curl

pinecone.list_collections()
Results

Shell

example-collection
Delete a collection
To delete a collection, use the delete_collection operation. Specify the name of the collection to delete.

Deleting the collection takes several minutes. During this time, the describe_collection operation returns the status "deleting".

Example

The following example deletes the collection example-collection.

Python
JavaScript
curl

pinecone.delete_collection("example-collection")
